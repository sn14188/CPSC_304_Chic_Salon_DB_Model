# Chic Salon

This project involves the creation of a database to manage various aspects of a hair salon. The database includes tables for storing information about the salon, stylists, services, appointments, payments, customer feedback, and more. The project also includes a web interface that allows users to interact with the database, view information, and perform various actions. The web interface is built using PHP and Oracle Database connectivity. Users can input data through web forms and perform actions on the database using buttons provided in the interface.
